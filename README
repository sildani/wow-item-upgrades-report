The scripts in the scripts directory grab World of Warcraft (WoW) Armory data and generate a CSV formatted report of the upgrade status of the items for a given realm and guild.

To start, get the data by running the following script:

ruby scripts/get_data.rb <realm> <guild>

To then generate the report from the data, run:

ruby scripts/gen_report.rb <guild>

You must get the data before you can generate a report.
