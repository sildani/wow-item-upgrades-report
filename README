The scripts in the scripts directory grab World of Warcraft (WoW) Armory data and generate a CSV formatted report of the upgrade status of the items for a given realm and guild.

Create a data directory, then run:

ruby scripts/get_data.rb <realm> <guild>

To then generate the report from the data, create a directory named "output" then run:

ruby scripts/gen_report.rb

You must get the data before you can generate a report.
